# sass-marlo

Personal Sass Utilities created by me! Will be updated as I come up with more utilities.

Feel free to use it!

## Usage

Use either `npm install sass-marlo` or `yarn add sass-marlo` depending on your package manager.

Import the style sheet into your projects main scss file with:

```scss
@import "node_modules/sass-marlo/sassmarlo"
```

### Reset and Normalize

CSS reset is also included - I included the meyerweb version.

Import into your main scss file with:

```scss
@import "node_modules/sass-marlo/reset"
```

Normalize is also included from [Necolas](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)

```scss
@import "node_modules/sass-marlo/normalize"
```
